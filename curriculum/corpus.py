### Builder lens · learn while building, prove as you go

Explain **{title}** in plain language. Build the smallest safe example. Change one
variable, compare the before/after result, and keep an RTMA artifact that another
learner can reproduce.

### Review ladder

Revisit at **1 hour → 24 hours → 7 days → 30 days → 90 days**. At each
review: state the general rule, name one exception, teach one worked example, and
write the observation that would falsify your claim.

### Extended proof card

| Field | Capture |
|-------|---------|
| Run | Exact command, input, model/fixture version |
| Trace | Ordered steps, tool calls, approvals, errors |
| Metric | Quality + latency + cost + safety signal |
| Artifact | Durable local file and reproduction note |

### 2026 production practice

- Hold the task and evaluator constant while changing one system variable.
- Compare local and frontier routes on privacy, pass rate, p95, and cost per verified task.
- Separate retrieval quality from answer quality; test stale, empty, and unauthorized evidence.
- Trace agent state, tool calls, approvals, corrections, assertions, and stop reason.
- Combine deterministic checks, calibrated model graders, and named human review.
- Pin model, prompt, data, index, tool, and policy versions; keep the last GREEN rollback.
